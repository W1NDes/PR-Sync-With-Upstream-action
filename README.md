# Github Action: Upstream Sync -use pull request

> 原先的fork-sync-with-upstream-action项目不支持以pr的形式同步上游更新，而wei/pull似乎不支持非fork仓库的自定义上游拉取，本项目修改了run/push_updates.sh中的push_new_commits()函数以实现pr形式的同步
> 
> *The original fork-sync-with-upstream-action project doesn't support syncing upstream updates in the form of PRs, and wei/pull doesn't seem to support custom upstream pulls for non-fork repositories. This project modifies the push_new_commits() function in run/push_updates.sh to enable synchronization in the form of PRs.*

## About

An action with forks in mind! Automatically sync a branch on your fork with the latest commits from the original repo. It should work to keep any two branches in sync. Keep all your things up to date!

## Support This Project

This project is not currently in active development, but code contributions are always welcome.

I encourage you to share projects using Fork Sync in the Users file. Open a PR against Users so others can check out your work!

## Intended Workflow

This action was made to keep **non-working** branches up to date with a remote repo. However, you should also be able to use it for branches under active development as long as the custom input supports your needs.

Configure the action with a branch on your `target` repo - the one you want to update - and a branch on your `upstream` repo - where the updates are coming from. This action checks out those branches on both repos, checks for any new commits (by hash comparison), and pulls those new commits from upstream to the target. Easy!

## How to Use

[Add a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart#creating-your-first-workflow) to your repo that includes this action ([sample below](#sample-workflow)). Please note that scheduled workflows only run on the default branch of a repo.

### Input Variables

| Name                       |     Required?      | Default | Example                                  |
| -------------------------- | :----------------: | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| target_sync_branch         | :white_check_mark: |         | 'master', 'main', 'my-branch'            |
| target_repo_token          | :white_check_mark: |         | ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}              |
| upstream_repo_access_token |                    |         | ${{ secrets.NAME_OF_TOKEN }}             |
| upstream_sync_repo         | :white_check_mark: |         | 'aormsby/Fork-Sync-With-Upstream-action' |
| upstream_sync_branch       | :white_check_mark: |         | 'master', 'main', 'my-branch'            |
| test_mode                  |                    | false   | true / false                             |

**Always** set `target_repo_token` to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` so the action can push to your target repo.
